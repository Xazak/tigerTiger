Having trouble getting libtcod to build from source for linux development:
--  SDL2 installed correctly from slackbuild
--  libtcod build fails at
		./configure CFLAGS='-02'
	--  Check config.log for explicit details; error states that
			C compiler was unable to build executables
		apparently due to unsupported compiler options like '-02'
	--  Still looking for relevant information...
	!!	Turns out the correct option is '-O2', NOT '-02' !!
--	libtcod appears to have installed correctly, need to try some builds and check
